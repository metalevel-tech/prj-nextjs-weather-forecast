# Task: Weather Visualization using React

Create a web application that displays the current weather forecast for a specific city.

## Requirements

The following functionalities should be included:

1. **City Selection**: Users must be able to input the name of a city and select a city from a dropdown list.

2. **API Integration**: Utilize a public weather API to fetch the current forecast for the selected city.

3. **Forecast Visualization**: Display information about the current temperature, humidity, wind speed, and other relevant data.

## Recommendations

1. Utilize React's useState for managing city and forecast data.

2. Use the fetch API or appropriate libraries to retrieve data from the weather API.

3. Create components for city input, forecast display, and data refreshing functionality.

4. Enhance the visual appeal of components using CSS or styling libraries.

## Note

Showcase your React expertise by crafting a well-organized application that meets the outlined requirements, effectively integrates with the weather API, and presents weather information in a user-friendly manner.

## How to share your work
